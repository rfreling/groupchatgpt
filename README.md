# 👨‍👩‍👧‍👦 GroupChatGPT

GroupChatGPT evolves [ChatGPT](https://openai.com/blog/chatgpt) from an awkward 1:1 conversation into a familiar group chat with your favorite characters.

Sometimes we learn more by listening than by talking...

This group chat is a lot of fun to play with but there are some surprisingly interesting ideas hidden underneath.

It combines a few compelling prompting patterns that hackers have been exploring:

- Using the System Message to guide ChatGPT to assume different worldviews (role playing)
- Using self-ask loops where the model responds to itself
- Modifying the chat history to help avoid model confusion

The end-results are fascinating and engaging conversations that draw you in with new ideas that you may not have thought of before.

The approach of alternating between multiple GPT worldviews/personas in loops may prove especially powerful in creative, educational, and research-based applications. Other projects like [CAMEL](https://github.com/camel-ai/camel) and [character.ai](https://character.ai/) have been exploring similar ideas.

Ask the group a question and see for yourself!

This implementation of GroupChatGPT is extremely basic... lots of room to build on and improve.
